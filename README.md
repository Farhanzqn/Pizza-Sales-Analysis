# 🍕 Strategic Pizza Sales Analysis: From Business Requirements to Actionable Insights

## 📋 Executive Summary
This project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis process, simulating a real-world business scenario. The objective was to transform raw sales data into strategic insights to optimize inventory management, staffing schedules, and marketing strategies.

Unique to this project, the analysis was strictly guided by a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**, ensuring that every line of code addresses a specific stakeholder need.

1.  **KPI Assessment:** Evaluating overall business health via Total Revenue, Average Order Value (AOV), and Total Orders.
2.  **Temporal Trends:** Identifying high-traffic periods (daily/monthly) to inform operational efficiency and resource allocation.
3.  **Product Performance:** Categorizing top and bottom-performing menu items to drive inventory and promotional decisions.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas (Data Cleaning, ETL, Aggregation)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib & Seaborn
* **Documentation:** Jupyter Notebook
